## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of common **data structures** and **algorithms** in multiple programming languages such as Python,C, C++, and Java. Each algorithm and data structure is accompanied by explanations and examples to help you understand how they work and where they can be used.

## Data Structures

The repository includes implementations of the following data structures:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
- Tries
- And more...

## Algorithms

The repository also covers implementations of various algorithms such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
- Greedy Algorithms (Huffman Encoding, Prim's Algorithm, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm, etc.)
- Divide and Conquer
- Backtracking
- Recursion
- And more...
